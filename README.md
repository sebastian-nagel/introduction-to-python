Course Materials – Workshop “Introduction to Python”
====================================================

This repository bundles course materials for a Python Programming
Workshop organized by the Cluster of Excellence “The Politics of
Inequality” at the University of Konstanz in cooperation with the
Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen in summer 2021.

Addressed to scholars in social sciences (in a very broad definition),
the workshop focuses on using Python in practice. The provided
hands-on examples will support the participants to use Python for
their own research interests.

As a short two-day workshop, some (limited) programming skills and a
first and basic understanding of the Python syntax are expected from
the participants.
